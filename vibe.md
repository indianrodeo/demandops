## Website Goal
Lean one-page site for Martech SaaS founders doing $100k-$1M ARR. Purpose: position me as their fractional marketing manager, embedded operator driving demand and growth.

## Core Message
"I work with Martech founders as their extended marketing team member." Everything on the page should reinforce that line without fluff.

## Site Structure
The site has **two folds** only.

### Fold 1: Hero (Above the Fold)
- **Headline:** Direct positioning with edge. Example:  
  `Black-and-white growth partner for Martech founders at $100k-$1M ARR`
- **Subline:** Crisp expansion reinforcing embedded ownership. Example:  
  `I run demand and pipeline so you keep building product.`
- **CTA Button:**  
  `Book a Call` -> solid white type on a black button; no secondary colors.

### Fold 2: Proof + Context (Below the Fold)
- **Section Title (optional):** `What I bring to the table`
- **Bullets (3-4 max):**  
  - Outbound demand that fills qualified demos  
  - Founder-led LinkedIn + PPC playbooks that compound  
  - SEO and content engines tuned for Martech buyers  
  - Funnel builds and nurture flows that close faster
- **Short Bio / Line:**  
  `I plug in as your embedded marketer, accountable for revenue outcomes from $100k ARR upward.`
- **Secondary CTA:** Repeat `Book a Call` with identical styling; no alternate colors.

## Vibe & Tone
- Monochrome only: deep black (#000) and white (#fff); leverage contrast and negative space.
- Bold typography, decisive copy, tight line lengths; everything signals "this is serious business."
- Speak directly to founders using short, declarative sentences; zero hedging.
- Page reads like a confident operator's calling card, not a brochure.

## Deliverables
- One-page, two-fold layout, mobile-first.
- Copy stays terse: short sentences, active voice, measurable outcomes.
- Layout uses stark spacing, typography, and contrast; no gradients, icons, or accent colors.
- Treat this as a fractional marketing manager's personal site built to close calls fast.
